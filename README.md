# js-raycasting-engine
This is my prototype of my 3D ray casting engine.
Since I ported it to C++ it will probably never be completed in JS. The JS version was just for test.

It's coded from scratch and no external libraries were used whatsoever.
Therefore it should run without any problems on any machine with a web browser.
